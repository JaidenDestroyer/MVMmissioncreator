# MVMmissioncreator
A website made for the purpose of making/loading/editing .pop files

__Current Features__

* Wavebar display
* Display waves as a flowchart 
* Load and generate popfiles 
* Detect errors when parsing (such as invalid datatypes)

__NOTES__

* I am currently phasing out codemirror from this project, so editor.html will __NOT__ run 
* Generator is not fully implemented
* New Gui Is Broken
* This code is poorly optimized
